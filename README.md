# Strichliste 2.0

  A reliable, no-maintenance solution to replace tally lists.

## History and Design Goals

During my time as the treasurer of my student dormitory, I hated counting the tally lists ontop of the drinks fridge.
Not hesitant to waste hours implementing and optimizing a computer system to avoid a small manual task ([relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1319/)), I created version of
[strichliste](https://github.com/maxmunzel/strichliste). After it served us for a few years, a vision for a better system came to mind. 

The requirements were:

1. Robustness in the face of network failures or server downtime
1. Foolproof to use for treasurers
1. Snappy on cheap hardware (We currently deploy 35â‚¬ Kindle HD tablets)
1. Completely zero-maintenance.
1. Easy backups.
1. Have pictures of both users and beverages
1. Make statistics accessible to the users
1. Have a dead-simple UI (users may be drunk from time to time)
1. Be reasonably secure and temper-proof
1. Easy deployment
1. Simple, easy to change code

The result is this system. Its fits our use-case nicely and just works (tm).

## Overview & Technologies used


### User Interface

The complete system is web-based. The user interface as well as the backoffice (called "backend" for historical reasons) is written in [elm](https://elm-lang.org).
The source code for the UI is in the `src` directory and split into `Main.elm` for the user facing stuff, `Backend.html` for backoffice and `Common.elm` for the
network code they both share. To ease deployment, the compiled `main.js` and `backend.html` are checked into the git repo.

### Database

A PostgreSQL database serves as the main datastore. A [postgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/) instance sits between the database and the rest of the world 
and provides auth as well as a REST API.

### API

All non-database api's are implemented in go. First, there's an `/auth` enpoint that trades passwords for jwts and also validates jwts.
A second endpoint `/api` is used to process images and serve some protected files like reports. Go is not nessessarily the best language for this
kind of use-case, but its robust standard library gives me confidence that I the code will compile and run for the forseeable future.

### Web Server

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) is used as both a reverse proxy for all the HTTP endpoints and also serves static files. It does HTTPS by itself and just works.

### Report Generation

The scripts in `/cronjobs` are run by a docker container connected to the database to generate billings and backups.

### Service Management

The whole project is packaged as a docker compose unit. This makes both deployment and development easier. I also make extensive use of it to
put services in private networks and limit their view on the filesystem. This should contain the effect of possible bugs.

## Deployment

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:maxmunzel/strichliste2.0.git
$ cd strichliste2.0
$ pip3 install pyjwt  # just needed to generate secrets. If you don't like python, send me an email and I generate secrets for you ;)
$ python3 init.py
Please Enter the Password used for setting up Tablets and backoffice access:
****************
Congig generation successful! Secrets stored in 'secrets.json'.
$ docker compose up --build
```

Thats basically it! The only thing left to do is configure the domain name in `Caddyfile` i.e. replace `:80` in the first line with `example.com` or whatever. Also setup backups for the whole folder.
